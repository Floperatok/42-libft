## üìë Introduction
The `get_next_line` function is a 42 project that complements the [libft](https://github.com/Floperatok/42-libft) first 42 project. The goal of this project is to write a function that reads a file line by line from on a given file descriptor. Each time the `get_next_line` function is called, it returns the next line found in the file, until the end of the file is reached.
Once the project is completed, we are invited to add this function to the [libft](https://github.com/Floperatok/42-libft) and reuset it freely on future projects.\
The `get_next_line` project enable us to learn file descriptors, static variables and memory management as well as using tools like [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to handle memory leaks.
